# Question | "Testing the Waters"

It's time to clean the fish tank! To put the fish back in the tank you need to test the pH level of the water. A safe level is between 6.5 and 9 on the pH scale.

Write an ``is_safe(water)`` function that checks if the water is a safe pH level for fish to live. The function needs to take one argument, the water's pH level.

```
Water pH Level		Output
6.5 to 9		Water is safe.
Less than 6.5		Too acidic!
More than 9		Too alkaline!
```

Test that your function works!

In the ``if`` ``__name__ == '__main__'``**:** block, add test cases for if the pH is 9 and 10.Then run your code again to check its outputs.
