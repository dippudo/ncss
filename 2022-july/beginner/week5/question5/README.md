# Question | "Southern Cross"

We've written some code to draw the southern cross - but we need some helper functions!

1. First let's write the ``move_to`` function. It should lift the pen up, go to the ``x`` and ``y`` coordinate, and then put the pen back down. You'll need to use the new ``goto`` turtle function you've learned!

2. Run your program to see how it works!

3. Now let's write the ``draw_star`` function. This function will draw a diamond shaped star with sides of length ``size``. Start by beginning a fill.

4. Continue the ``draw_star`` function - now we'll draw a star.

Start by turning ``right`` ``60`` degrees. Then draw the diamond using:

* Four sides of length ``size``;
* Two ``left`` turns of ``120`` degrees at the top and bottom points;
* One ``left`` turn of ``60`` degrees for the point on the right.
* Finish the diamond with a ``left`` turn of ``120`` degrees (so the turtle faces right).

5. Finish off the function by ending the fill. Now **run your program**.
