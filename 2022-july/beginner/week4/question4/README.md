# Question | "Word Wizard"

A [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) is a word made by combining parts of two other words.

For example, **br**eakfast and l**unch** would make **brunch**.

Let's make some of our own!

Write a program that asks a user for two words and then takes the first two letters of the first word and the last 4 letters of the second word and combines them to make a new word. *(N.B. we won't test your program with any input that's too short!)*

It works like this:

```
Two words? chair table
The new word is: chable
```

Here's another example:

```
Two words? skirt shorts
The new word is: skorts
```
