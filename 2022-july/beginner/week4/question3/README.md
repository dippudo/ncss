# Question | "Directional Adventures"

You're building a [text adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)! The user tells the game which way they want to go (**N**orth, **S**outh, **E**ast, or **W**est).

The commands are in the form Go ``S`` then ``W``, but can be any two directions.

Write a program that asks the user for a command, and then prints the two directions (the **fourth** and **eleventh** characters of the command).

It should work like this:

```
Command? Go N then W
NW
```

Here's another example:

```
Command? Go S then E
SE
Command? Go S then E
SE
```
