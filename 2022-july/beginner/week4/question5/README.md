# Question | "Spies Have Problems Too"

We've written a function which takes a word and encrypts it. We've explained a bit about this function in the hint below, but for this problem you just have to call it!

Use the ``encrypt`` function to help construct a secret message:

```
Person? Doris
Find Firou.
Location? Central
They will be at Eartnen.
Password? platypus
The password is rupytalu.
```

Here the encrypt function changed ``Doris`` into ``Firou``, ``Central`` into ``Eartnen``, and ``platypus`` into ``rupytalu``.
