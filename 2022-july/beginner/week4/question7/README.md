# Question | "Filled In Shapes"

We're going to draw coloured shapes with any number of sides! Let's use a loop to draw different shapes.

1. Set the background colour to ``'plum'``, and the fill colour to ``'cornflowerblue'``. Also set the pen size to ``10`` and the pen colour to ``'royalblue'``. Then ask for the number of sides and save that to a variable. Remember to convert it to an integer.

2. Calculate the angle you will need to turn between each side of your shape, and save it in a variable. The angle you need to turn is:

*turn angle = 360 / number of sides*

3. Start the fill.

4. Create a ``for`` loop to draw the right number of sides. Each side should be ``40`` turtle steps long. Turn between each side, using the angle you calculated earlier.

5. End the fill, so that we have colour inside our shape. Make sure to end the fill *outside* the loop!
