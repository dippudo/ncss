# Question | "Prickly shape"

Lets make a prickly shape! We'll ask the user how long each side should be.

Our program will work like this:

**The shape has 6 sides, and the angle between each side is 60Â°.**

1. Set the pen to have a colour of ``pink`` and a size of ``5``. Then ask for the length of the sides and save that to a variable. Remember to convert it to an integer!

2. Create a ``for`` loop. It should use ``range`` to draw a ``6`` sided shape.

3. For each side, move ``forward`` by the length you stored in the variable, then turn ``left`` ``60`` degrees.

Then, move backward to draw the spike of the next side. The spike is **half the length of the side**.

4. Run your program to check how it works. Remember, it should work for any sides of *any* length:
