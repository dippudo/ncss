# Question | "Descriptive Desserts"

You're opening a bakery! You want to print out some labels for your baked goods.

Write a program to describe the things you sell.

```
Sweet treat	Description
Pastry		Buttery flaky goodness
Cake		A light and fluffy classic
Cookie		Warm and crispy on the edges
```

Your program should ask the user for the name of a treat and then print out the description, like this:

```
Treat? Pastry
Buttery flaky goodness
```

This is what happens when the treat isn't in the table:

```
Treat? Lemon tart
We do not sell that. It sounds yum!
```
