# Question | "Not So Smart"

The secret agent [Maxwell Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart) is not very good at keeping his identity secret, he is always telling people his real name! Let's help him keep it secret.

Ask the user for their name. If it contains the word ``Smart``, replace it with ``SURNAME``. Otherwise, it should print ``Identity safe``.

It should work like this:

```
Spy name: Smart, Maxwell Smart
SURNAME, Maxwell SURNAME
```

Here's what happens when no one mentions Smart:

```
Spy name: Agent 99
Identity safe.
Spy name: Agent 99
Identity safe.
```
