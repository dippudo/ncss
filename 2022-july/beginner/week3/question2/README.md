# Question | "Lights, Camera, Action!"

You love making online videos and you've recently learned the ideal video length for getting the most views.

Write a program that asks for the video's length in minutes, and tells you if it's too short, too long, or if it's the perfect video length.

```
Video Length	Output
Less than 6	Too short!
More than 10	Too long!
6 to 10		Perfect video length!
```

This is what should happen if the video is the right length of time:

```
Video length? 8
Perfect video length!
```

Here's what should happen if the video is too long:

```
Video length? 100
Too long!
```
