# Question | "Cheer to Win"

You are practising to win points for cheering on your house in the Athletics Carnival.

Write a program that reads the house name and turns it into a chant! It should work like this:

```
Who do we want to win? GROK
Give me G!
Give me R!
Give me O!
Give me K!
GO GROK!
```
