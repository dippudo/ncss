# Question | "Fenced In"

Let's get the turtle to help us draw a fence.

**Each picket is 60 steps long, and the gap between each picket is 10 steps. The pickets start 20 steps to the right.**

1. Ask for the number of pickets and save it to a variable. Don't forget to convert it to an integer!

2. Set the colour of the pen to ``peru`` and the size of the pen to ``5``.

3. Lift the pen, move forward ``20`` steps, and place the pen back down. Then turn left.

4. Create a ``for`` loop using ``range``. It will repeat for each of the pickets you need to draw.

5. Inside the ``for`` loop, draw a picket ``60`` steps long, and then return back to the start of the picket.

To create the gap, lift the pen up, turn to face to the left. Now move the turtle ``10`` steps and turn back to the original direction. *Don't forget to put the pen back down!*
