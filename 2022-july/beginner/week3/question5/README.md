# Question | "Novel Decisions"

You're writing a novel, but you're not sure what to call it. You want to make sure it looks good on the spine of a book!

Write a program that reads in a book title, and prints it out both horizontally and vertically so you can compare.

It should work like this:

```
Book title? Poems
Poems
P
o
e
m
s
```

It doesn't matter if it has spaces, like this:

```
Book title? An Epic
An Epic
A
n
 
E
p
i
c
```
