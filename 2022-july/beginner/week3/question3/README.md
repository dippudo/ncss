# Question | "No "You Know Who" Here"


You're an editor at [The Daily Prophet](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Prophet), and one of your writers keeps using *You Know Who's* name in the articles they write. You need to edit it out!

Write a program to change every sentence to use ``You Know Who`` instead of ``Voldemort``. It should work like this:

```
Sentence? Tom Riddle is Voldemort!
Tom Riddle is You Know Who!
```

It should also work if there's more than one Voldemort, like this:

```
Sentence? Voldemort, Voldemort, ooh Voldy Voldemort
You Know Who, You Know Who, ooh Voldy You Know Who
```
