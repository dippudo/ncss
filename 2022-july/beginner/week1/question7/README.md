# Question | "Boxed In"

Let's make a box!

We've given you the sizes for the **short** and **long** sides, and have started the box. You need to complete it!

1. Click run to see what the program draws so far.

The turtle moves forward the number of steps saved in `short_side`, then turns `left` ready to draw the next side.

2. Move forward to draw the first `long side`. Use the variable `long_side` for the number of steps.

3. Keep going! The rest of the code is up to you.
