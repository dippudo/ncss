# Question | "And You Know It!"

We want to write the lyrics to the popular song If you are happy and you know it!

1. Click Run to see what you have so far.

2. Change the ``line1`` and ``line2`` variables to sing a new verse:

The first line should say ``'If you are grumpy and you know it'``

The second line should then say ``'Stomp your feet'``

3. Run your program again. It should print the following:

```
If you are grumpy and you know it
Stomp your feet
If you are grumpy and you know it
Stomp your feet
If you are grumpy and you know it
and you really want to show it
If you are grumpy and you know it
Stomp your feet
```
