# Question | "Bug Fix: Time for a Break"

A friend has written some code to tell you how many hours are left until lunch.

You try it out, but it's not working! It's got a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)!

Fix the bug!

The error says the bug is somewhere in line 3:
``left = 12 - now``

The code subtracts ``now`` from ``12``.

But now is a string and not a number! Fix it by changing only the first line.

Run the program again and see if it works.

It should print:

```
3
```
