# Question | "PArrty!"

You are throwing a pirate themed party and the costume hire shop will give you a really good discount if you can order enough outfits at once.

To get the discount you need at least 15 people to confirm they are coming. Write a program to find out if you have enough people coming to your party.

If you have **fewer than 15 people** it should say:

```
How many pirates? 5
No discount.
```

Otherwise, it should say:

```
How many pirates? 19
Cheap costumes!
How many pirates? 19
Cheap costumes!
```
