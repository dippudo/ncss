# Question | "Overjoyed!"

An emoticon is short for an "emotion icon", a picture representation to express a person's feelings, mood or reaction.

You are going to create the emoticon ^_^ for overjoyed.

Weâ€™ll ask the user to decide the emoticon's colour.

```
Colour? skyblue
```

**The triangle sides are 60 steps, the nose is 30 steps and the gap is 10 steps.**

1. Ask the user's input for colour and store it in a variable called ``colour``. Don't forget to leave a space after the question mark.

2. Set the ``pencolor`` to the variable you have created and the ``pensize`` to ``3``. *Don't forget the American spelling of colour is color.*

3. Let's draw the first eye. Turn ``left`` ``60`` degrees, then move ``forward`` ``60`` steps to draw the first side.

Turn ``right`` ``120`` degrees, then draw the second side.

Turn ``left`` ``60`` degrees to get in position for the next step.

4. Now we need to draw the mouth between the two eyes! Lift your ``penup`` and move ``forward`` ``10`` steps.

Put the pen down and draw the mouth ``30`` steps long.

Lift your pen and move ``forward`` again, ready to draw the right eye.

5. Finally we need to draw the right eye! Repeat step 3 to draw it. *Don't forget to put your pendown.*

6. Run your code with different input, it should work for any colour. If it looks right, then mark it!
