# Question | "Sushi Session"

You're meeting up with a friend to grab some lunch.

Let's write a program that asks where you're going for lunch. The program should always reply ``Meet you there!``

```
Time for lunch!
Where are we going? falafels
Meet you there!
```

If you say you're going to sushi it should also tell you ``I love sushi!``

```
Time for lunch!
Where are we going? sushi
I love sushi!
Meet you there!
```
