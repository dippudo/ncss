# Question | "Tricky Kittens"

The Guinness World Record for the most tricks by a cat in one minute is held by Didga the cat. The record is **24** tricks.

Write a program that asks how many tricks your cat can do. If the number is **greater than 24** then it should do this:

```
How many tricks? 28
New world record!
```

Otherwise it should do this:

```
How many tricks? 5
No record yet. Keep training!
```
