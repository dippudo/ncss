# Question | "Sportsmanteau"

A [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) is a blend of words which form a new word.
Examples are ``spork`` (``spoon`` and ``fork``), and ``hangry`` (``hungry`` and ``angry``).

Write a program which will create a new ball game portmanteau by adding ``ball`` to a word or part of a word like this:

```
Word? Fris
Frisball
```

**Your program should also work with other words.**

```
Word? Calvin
Calvinball
```

*Remember, the* ``blue text`` *is output, while* ``black text`` *is input.*
