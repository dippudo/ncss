# Question | "My Precious"

In [The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit), Bilbo wins a game of riddles with Gollum by asking, *'What have I got in my pocket?'*

Write a program to ask the riddle. If the answer is ``ring``, your program should print: ``My precious!``

```
What have I got in my pocket? ring
My precious!
```

If the answer is anything else, it should print: ``Wrong!``

```
What have I got in my pocket? nothing
Wrong!
```
