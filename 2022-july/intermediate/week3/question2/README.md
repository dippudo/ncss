# Question | "Little Bug"

Your little sister is driving you mad singing the song "Little Bug" (...do doo de do doo de do, little bug...) all day long.

You have decided to write a program to make up new lyrics and get your revenge.

Your program should keep asking for a lyric and then print it out followed by the chorus ``"Do doo de do do de doo..."``.

If your lyric includes the word ``"end"`` *(with **any** capitalisation)* then the program should print out ``"It's the end"`` and finish.

Here's an example:

```
Lyric: Little Bug
Little Bug
Do doo de do do de doo...
Lyric: it's the end
It's the end
```

Here's another example:

```
Lyric: Little Bug
Little Bug
Do doo de do do de doo...
Lyric: scary spider
scary spider
Do doo de do do de doo...
Lyric: wriggly worm
wriggly worm
Do doo de do do de doo...
Lyric: I think it's The End
It's the end
```

**Note:** ``"end"`` may be anywhere in the input.
