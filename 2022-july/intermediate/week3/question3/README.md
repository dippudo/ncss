# Question | "Cameras or Camelopards?"

Your friend Cam wants to open a store, but they don't know what to sell. They thought of 'Cam's Cameras' but want you to come up with three more potential stocks that work with their name.

Write a program that asks for things to sell until it's collected three containing the string ``'cam'`` (with any capitalisation). It should then print the list of stocks in reverse alphabetical order, because Cam is a bit crazy.

Here's an example of how your program should work:

```
Shop stock: Camels
Shop stock: Camping gear
Shop stock: Books
Shop stock: Camouflage
Proposals: Camping gear, Camouflage, Camels
```

Here's another example:

```
Shop stock: Camelopards
Shop stock: Cannons
Shop stock: boot camps
Shop stock: candle jars
Shop stock: Cameraphones
Proposals: boot camps, Cameraphones, Camelopards
```

'Camelopard' is a synonym for a giraffe ðŸ¦’.
