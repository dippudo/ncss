# Question | "Toad Trouble"

When early settlers colonised Australia they started growing sugarcane, but ran into a problem — their crops were eaten by native beetles. As a solution they introduced cane toads!

Unfortunately that didn’t solve the beetle problem, and now the cane toad population increases by 14% every year.
Expressed as an equation, this looks like:

*(pop. 1 year later) = (pop. now) + 0.14 × (pop. now)*

Write a program that asks for the starting population of cane toads, and a final population. Calculate how many years need to have passed to reach the final population of cane toads. Output the result as a whole number of years.

Your program should look like this:

```
Initial population: 2400
Final population: 8000
It would take 10 years for there to be 8000 cane toads.
```

Another example:

```
Initial population: 20
Final population: 2000
It would take 36 years for there to be 2000 cane toads.
```
