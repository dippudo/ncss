# Question | "Destination Deliberation"

You're planning a holiday next July and are considering destination cities!

The temperature is an important factor in your decision â€“ you'd like to visit somewhere warm enough! ðŸ˜Ž

We've given you a dictionary that contains data on the average temperature in July for some cities.

Write a program that asks for a minimum temperature, and then prints out only the cities which have a July average that is at or above this minimum.

Here's an example of how your program should work:

```
Minimum temp: 25.7
Take a holiday to...
Beijing
Mumbai
Bangkok
Ho Chi Minh City
Nassau
Cairo
```

Here's another example:

```
Minimum temp: 11.9
Take a holiday to...
Beijing
Mumbai
Tokyo
Seoul
Bangkok
Ho Chi Minh City
Vienna
Brussels
Helsinki
Berlin
Rome
Amsterdam
Edinburgh
Istanbul
Nassau
Ottawa
Mexico City
Rio de Janeiro
Lima
Cairo
Nairobi
```
