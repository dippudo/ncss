# Question | "Puttering around"

You're organising some friendly golf games, and want to keep track of the scores.

Let's build a scorecard to help!

Your scorecard should ask for a player's name, then how many strokes they took on each hole. It should keep asking until a blank name is entered.

It should then print out the final score of each player!

Here's an example of how your program should work:

```
Player: Ron
Score: 2
Player: Cam
Score: 3
Player: Cam
Score: 1
Player: 
Final Results:
Ron: 2
Cam: 4
```

Here's another example:

```
Player: Deb
Score: 5
Player: Verity
Score: 3
Player: Yan
Score: 1
Player: Tousif
Score: 2
Player: Tousif
Score: 3
Player: Verity
Score: 3
Player: Deb
Score: 3
Player: 
Final Results:
Deb: 8
Verity: 6
Yan: 1
Tousif: 5
```

**We'll always enter the Score if we provide a Player name.**
