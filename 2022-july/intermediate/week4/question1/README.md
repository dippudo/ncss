# Question | "Birdwatching"

You're a birdwatcher, and you like to keep track of what bird you've seen and where you first saw it.

We've given you a *dictionary* called ``journal`` containing bird types and the location where you saw it.

Your program should ask for a bird as input, then print out the location if that bird is a key in the dictionary.

Here's an example of how your program should work:

```
Enter a bird: Ibis
Bin near the beach.
```

If the bird isn't in the dictionary, a short message should be printed:

```
Enter a bird: cassowary
Never seen that bird!
```

*All keys in the dictionary are in **lower case**.* Your program should work with input words in any case:

```
Enter a bird: MAGPIE
Swooping in local park.
```
