# Question | "Talk the Talk"

Politicians are known for talking the talk, but sometimes they waffle on a bit.

We're going to take an old political speech, cut down the number of words in it, and see if we can still understand the point!

We've given you 5 different speeches, plenty of material.

Write a program to extract words from a speech and put them together into a new paragraph. Your program should take **every fifth word from the first 200 words** of the speech, then print them out.

Your program should look like this:

```
Speech file: gettysburg.txt
Four ago upon nation, dedicated all Now a whether nation dedicated, are battle-field have portion a those lives live. and do larger dedicateâ€”we not men, struggled far to world long here, forget It living, here which have advanced. us to
```

**Note**: There *isn't a space* at the very end of the new paragraph.

Here's another example:

```
Speech file: gillard.txt
Thank Speaker oppose the And say the be misogyny will will sexism man. The says sexist misogynists high the has paper out he misogyny Australia, motion Representatives, That's go repulsive standards misogyny now that Opposition Slipper's is Opposition this a
```

**We will test your code with other input files in addition to the five we have provided.**
