Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
And bring some out here

For we all like figgy pudding
We all like figgy pudding
We all like figgy pudding
So bring some out here

We won't go until we've got some
We won't go until we've got some
So bring some out here
