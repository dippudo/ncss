# Question | "Best Bird"

You're running a competition to find Australia's favourite bird! You've been put in charge of collecting the data from every city.

All the nominations for the award have been put in a big file, but many birds are nominated more than once. You want to make a list that contains each type of bird only once.

Write a program that asks for a city's nomination file, and prints out the contents so each bird is only listed once. The final nominees should be printed in **phabetical order**

Here's an example in a city with only a few nominations:

```
Enter a city file: hobart.txt
And the nominees are...
🐦 Forty-spotted pardalote
🐦 Pelican
🐦 Turbo chook
🐦 Wedge-tailed eagle
```

Here's an example where there a lots of nominations:

```
Enter a city file: sydney.txt
And the nominees are...
🐦 Currawong
🐦 Ibis
🐦 Kookaburra
🐦 Lyrebird
🐦 Magpie
🐦 Rainbow lorikeet
🐦 Red wattlebird
🐦 Regent Honeyeater
🐦 Sulphur-crested cockatoo
🐦 Tawny frogmouth
```
