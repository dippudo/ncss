# Question

Lots of names are tricky to spell, and there can be multiple spellings for one name. Write a program to spell out a person's name, with each letter on a new line. Finish up by greeting that person by name.

Your program should ask the user to input their name and then print each letter in **upper case** on a new line. After printing the letters, print 'Hello' plus the name in **lower case**.

```
What is your name? Alice
A
L
I
C
E
Hello alice
```
Here's another example:
```
What is your name? Ishan
I
S
H
A
N
Hello ishan
```
