# Question | "Sail Sale"

The boating store you work at is having a sale. Your boss has given you the discount list for all sale products.

**Write a program to calculate the sale price of a product, given its discount.** The program should ask for:

* the name of the product,
* the original price of the product, and
* the discount in %.

**Your program should then calculate the sale price as a float. You should also round the quantity to two decimal places.**

*sale = (1-discount/100) * original*

We've started a helper function for you, called sale_price, that you should use to do the calculation above. Call this helper function when you write the rest of your program.

Your program should work like this:
```
Product: Nylon catamaran sail
Original price ($): 1349
Discount (%): 15
Nylon catamaran sail on sale for $1146.65.
```

Here's another example:

```
Product: Pink lifejacket
Original price ($): 39.99
Discount (%): 33
Pink lifejacket on sale for $26.79.
```
