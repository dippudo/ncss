# Question | "Angry Posts"

You're moderating an internet forum, and you want to create a metric to determine how angry your users are. One simple way could be to count the number of uppercase words in each post.

Write a program that asks a user to enter a forum post, then prints how many words are angry, that is, all uppercase:

```
Post: OMG. Can't believe it. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?
Number of angry words: 6
```

Here's another example:

```
Post: Great advice, thanks a lot! :)
Number of angry words: 0
```
