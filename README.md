# NCSS Challenge Programs
A repository for Dippudo's answers to the NCSS Programming Competition


> **What is the NCSS Challenge?**
The NCSS Challenge is a programming competition open to all school students and teachers. The Grok Academy team have been running coding competitions like the challenge for over 12 years.

This repository contains programs mainly coded in Python. The code is for questions from beginner and intermediate challenges. Questions get increasingly more challenging as the weeks go on, and, obviously, intmediate questions are harder than beginner questions.

Through the NCSS Challenge I was able to broaden my knowledge of Pythons functions and use-cases. Learning about dictionaries and .txt files in Python was especially cool for me.

*Note: the last intermediate question required me to convert .txt files (provided by user input) into dictionaries which had the code had to read from - this took suprinsingly long and provided a healthy challenge for me to complete*
