# NCSS Challenge Programs
A repository for Dippudo's answers to the NCSS Programming Competition


> **What is the NCSS Challenge?**
The NCSS Challenge is a programming competition open to all school students and teachers. The Grok Academy team have been running coding competitions like the challenge for over 12 years.

This repository contains programs mainly coded in Python. The code is for questions from beginner and intermediate challenges. Questions get increasingly more challenging as the weeks go on, and, obviously, intmediate questions are harder than beginner questions. <br><br> *(The very first beginner question was literally a ``'Hello, World!'`` print)*

<br> 

## Notes
* **Things start to get interesting** around [Week 3 of the Intermediate Course](https://github.com/dippudo/ncss/tree/main/2022-july/intermediate/week3) onwards: that is where we start working on questions relating to ``while`` loops, ``dictionaries``, and ``.txt`` files and their use cases.


* **Through the NCSS Challenge I was able to broaden my knowledge of Python functions and use-cases**. Learning about dictionaries and .txt files in Python was especially cool for me.


* ***Note:** the last intermediate question required me to convert .txt files (provided by user input) into dictionaries which had the code had to read from - this took suprinsingly long and provided a healthy challenge for me to complete*


* **You may notice some of my programming formatting habits:** <br> I like to add a lot of blank spaces in between lines of code to make it more readable, unreadability is hard to tolerate for me. I may have comments every now and then, but not overly-excessive. When declaring strings in python, I favour the use of double quotes ``" "`` over single quotes ``' '``, on very rare occassions do I use single quotes.
